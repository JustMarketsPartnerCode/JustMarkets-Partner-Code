<h1>JustMarkets Leverage & Spreads Explained: How They Impact Your Trades</h1>
    <h2>Understanding Leverage in Forex Trading</h2>
    <p>Leverage is one of the most powerful tools available to Forex traders, allowing them to control larger positions with a smaller capital investment. JustMarkets offers flexible leverage options, enabling traders to amplify their potential gains while maintaining control over their risk exposure.</p>
    <p>At JustMarkets, traders can access leverage as high as <strong>1:3000</strong>, which is significantly higher than what many other brokers offer. This means that for every $1 in your trading account, you can control up to $3000 in market positions. However, while leverage can magnify profits, it also increases the risk of losses, making it crucial for traders to use proper risk management strategies.</p>
    <h2>The Role of Spreads in Trading Costs</h2>
    <p>Spreads represent the difference between the bid and ask prices of a currency pair and serve as a key factor in determining trading costs. JustMarkets is renowned for offering some of the most competitive spreads in the industry, starting from <strong>0.0 pips</strong> on Raw Spread accounts. Lower spreads reduce trading costs and provide traders with more opportunities to maximize their profits.</p>
    <h3>The spread you receive depends on the type of account you choose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard Account:</strong> Competitive floating spreads, ideal for beginners.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Account:</strong> Lower spreads with added premium features.</li>
        <li><strong>Raw Spread Account:</strong> Ultra-tight spreads from 0.0 pips, suited for professional traders.</li>
    </ul>
